					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout my professional experience I've had a passion for
						exploring new technologies and a strong entrepreneurial drive that
						has given me a diverse array of experience in the marketplace.

								<h2>Marketing Manager</h2>
								<p>
									Early in my career, I led to the expansion of a marketing team
									at a Brooklyn-based app development startup. Here, I led
									digital strategy, and helped to lay the groundwork for the
									company's growth in a competitive market. This job showed me
									at an early age that my efforts can have a direct impact in
									the growth of a business. This helped to lead me down the path
									of creating my own company.

								<h2>Mobile App Entrepreneur</h2>
								<p>
									After this experience I became engrossed in entrepreneurship
									and was a fellow at the Leslie eLab Entrepreneurship Center at
									NYU. I taught myself to code and built a mobile app using
									Swift called Playbook that used RSS technologies to streamline
									blog reading experience directly from your phone. We saw some
									early successes and was a top app of the day on Product Hunt.

								<h2>Cryptocurrency Asset Manager</h2>
								<p>
									Continuing my entrepreneurial journey, I eventually became the
									sole founder of a cryptocurrency hedge fund that managed over
									1000 BTC. This venture gave me a lot of experience in
									navigating emerging markets &amp; technologies. However, this
									venture also came with significant challenges, my overly eager
									nature and missteps ended up resulting in the bankruptcy of
									the fund and my conviction for wire fraud. This period has
									been a profound learning experience for me and taught me the
									importance of transparency and business ethics.

					<p>
						Beyond my professional endeavors, I've been actively involved in the
						tech startup scene. I cultivated a large following on social media
						where I shared my insights and experiences in the crypto markets. My
						journey, marked by both achievements and setbacks, reflects my
						eagerness to explore new markets and technologies, and learn from
						both my successes and failures.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am eager to re-enter the marketplace and use my lived experiences
						to help build and grow new technologies.
